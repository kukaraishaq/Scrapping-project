Overview
This project is a high-performance Python data pipeline built to harvest product data from duramotion.nl. It transitions from a Dutch-language sitemap discovery to a full English-language product extraction, resulting in a structured Excel catalog with interactive features.

The Engineering Problem
Standard "brute-force" scrapers often fail on this site due to:

Complex Pagination: Traditional ?page=x URL structures return redundant data.

Language Barriers: The site defaults to Dutch, but the catalog requires English data.

Dynamic Content: Product IDs are frequently nested or inconsistent across different categories.

The Engineering Solution (Architecture)
I designed a three-phase pipeline to overcome these obstacles:

Sitemap Discovery (LXML Parsing): Instead of crawling the front end, the script parses the sitemap.xml directly to get a 100% accurate list of current product URLs.

Language-Bridge Logic: The script fetches the Dutch landing page, identifies the hreflang="en" metadata, and pivots to the English version of the page for extraction.

Resilient Extraction (Dual-Layer):

Layer 1: Targeted HTML selection via BeautifulSoup.

Layer 2 (Fallback): If HTML classes change, the script automatically parses the application/ld+json schema (SEO metadata) to ensure the Product Code (MPN/SKU) is always captured.

Multi-Threaded Performance: Implemented ThreadPoolExecutor (5 workers) to speed up the 299+ page crawl without triggering server-side rate limits.

Key Features
Auto-Normalized Links: Converts all relative paths (/files/...) into absolute, clickable URLs.

Excel Hyperlinking: Uses the xlsxwriter engine to generate blue, clickable links for Images and PDFs directly in the Excel file.

Progress Tracking: Integrated terminal feedback for real-time monitoring of the 1000-page limit.

Clean Data Formatting: Preserves multi-line descriptions and strips all "noise" (extra whitespace) from product codes.
